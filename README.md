# Object Detection

Run object detection in browser using Tensorflow.js with COCO-SSD model.

The project was started by using the Google Codelabs' [TensorFlow.js: Make a smart webcam in JavaScript with a pre-trained Machine Learning model](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflowjs-object-detection/index.html).
